<!--Define parameters for physical units
Name: Key to access data
MovementParticleEffect: Name of particle effect to play when unit moves. May be ommitted.
Mass: mass of unit. Affects response to forces
MoveForce: Magnitude of force applied per second while unit is trying to move itself
MaxSpeed: Cap on magnitude of unit velocity
DecelerationFactor: Percent decrease in speed per second. Every frame, speed = speed * (1 - deceleration_factor) * elapsed_seconds
Health: How much damage a unit can take before dying
